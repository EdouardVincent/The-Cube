# The-Cube
2D video game
Hello everybody,

Today I'am happy show an idea that I got. My game is pretty simple, you have a cube that you have to moove to the arrival. You can compare my game at the game "Tomb of
the Mask" but my game is different and more simple. Actually, I made a map generator which makes random maps? which makes each map unique. I think that this game could
be funny to play. But now, the game isn't finished, I put it on github to show you the updates and also because I code on 2 different computers. So that's more easy forme to upload my code and my images on GitHub. Even if my game isn't finished, you can try to launch it and maybe check the code (don't worry the code is in english). I done that with Python 3.9 with the last version of Pygame (2.0.1). I work on Windows and sometimes on rpi4.

**(If you try to launch my game then u receive an unicode error, don't worry ! Go to the lines which load the images and just remove the \\ and put a simple \)**

Goodbye !
