# The-Cube
2D video game

Hello everybody,

Today I'am happy to show an idea that I got. My game is pretty simple, you have a cube that you have to moove to the arrival. You can compare my game at the game "Tomb of the Mask" but my game is different and more simple. Actually, I made a map generator which makes random maps which makes each map unique. I think that this game could be funny to play. You can try to launch it and maybe check the code (don't worry the code is in english). I'm now coding with Visual Studio Code with the last version of Pygame (2.0.1). I work on Windows and sometimes on rpi4.

**(If you try to launch my game then u receive an unicode error, don't worry ! Go to the lines which load the images and just remove the \\\ and put a simple \\)**

Goodbye !
